# Air Quality Analysis & Visualization Tool (Python Executable)

This Python-based tool is designed for environmental professionals and researchers to perform quick analysis and visualization of air quality CAAQMS datasets ‚Äî without needing to write code, even rename downloaded file, or sort data, or even work on excel.



## üöÄ Usage

1. **Run the executable (.exe application file)**
   - The program uses a graphical interface, so no command-line input is required.

2. **Prompt: "Select your data file."**
   - A file dialog will open to select your Excel or CSV file containing the data.
   - Required structure: Excel file downloaded from CAAQMS portal- both types current year and historical data


3. Output: `<Station_name>_<City_name>_SummaryTable.xlsx`
   - saved in the path where provided CAAQMS_data file is stored.
   

4. **Prompt: "Select Pollutants for Hourly Average Plot"**
    - Above prompt will give list of available pollutants- Enter pollutant names separated by commas if selecting more than one.
    - Output-<Station_name>_<City_name>_<Pollutant_name>_Hourly_Variations_Plot.jpg


5. **Prompt: "Dataset selection- Enter 'hourly' for plots on hour wise distribution data, or 'whole' for plots on entire dataset"**
    - It will convert data into hourly average if entered 'hourly' and then plots box or violin, otherwise if eneterd 'whole' it will plot on the actual data provided.
  
6. **Prompt: ‚ÄúEnter 'box' for Box Plot or 'violin' for Violin Plot"
    - Output-<Station_name>_<City_name>_<DatasetSelection-Whole/Hourly>_<PlotType-Violin?Box>-Plot.jpg`


5. **Prompt: ‚ÄúDo you want a line plot? (yes/no)‚Äù**
   - Enter `yes` to generate time series line plots.
   - Next prompt: Choose `all` to plot all pollutants or list specific ones separated by commas.
   - For each pollutant:
     - Plot saved as: `<station_name>_<city_name>_<pollutant>_Line_Plot.jpg`
   - If `all` is selected:
     - Combined plot saved as: `<station_name>_<city_name>_All_Pollutants_Line_Plot.jpg`

6. **Prompt: ‚ÄúDo you want to create an infographic? (yes/no)‚Äù**
   - Enter `yes` to build a custom infographic.

7. **Infographic Customization Prompts:**
   - Enter title for infographic.- Type or copy main title to be put in the infographic
   - Enter subtitle.- Type or copy subtitle to be put below main title in the infographic
   - Enter first paragraph (required).- Type or copy description you want to write in left half side of infographic
   - Enter second paragraph (optional).- Type or copy description you want to write below first paragraph.
   - Select background image (optional).- Select file which will be used in the background of infographic.
   - Select up to 3 plot images (optional, recommended from the earlier outputs).- Select file one by one to be put in right half side of infographic one above another.

8. **Infographic Output:**
   - Final styled image saved as: `final_infographic.png`
   - Saved in the same directory as the script or `.exe`.
